/**
 * <p>
 * The GatewayContext class is designed to encapsulate the context of a gateway
 * request. It holds information regarding the request and response data,
 * headers, and the processing state of the gateway. This class is useful for
 * managing the data flow in a gateway system, allowing for caching and easy
 * access to request/response details throughout the processing lifecycle.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * It includes flags for controlling whether to read request and response data,
 * and it provides storage for various components of the request such as the
 * body, headers, and form data. The class also tracks the start time of the
 * request for performance monitoring.
